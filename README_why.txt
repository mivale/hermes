Why this name?
Well...searching for a new and meaningful name can be quite hard!
So, why not settle for a greek name? But one with a meaning!
Therefore from behindthename.com i got this!

HERMES

Gender: Masculine
Usage: Greek Mythology
Other Scripts: ‘Ερμης (Ancient Greek)
Pronounced: HUR-meez (English)  [key]

Possibly meaning "cairn, pile of stones" in Greek. Hermes was a Greek god associated with speed and good luck, who served as a messenger to Zeus. He was also the patron of travellers, 
writers, athletes, merchants, thieves and orators.

And, since we're building a messaging application, "great Messenger of the gods" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes] is a pretty apt name ;-)
